Fundación Creciendo Feliz is a private kindergarten located in San José, Costa Rica, specifically in the Pavas area, near Demasa. Our mission is to provide a safe and nurturing environment for children, particularly those from low-income families, whose parents need to work during the day.

We collaborate closely with organizations like PANI and IMAS, receiving financial support to ensure that these children have access to quality education and care. Parents can bring their children to our foundation in the morning, and pick them up after work, knowing they are in good hands. We offer not only educational activities and daycare services but also provide nutritious meals throughout the day.

In addition to serving low-income families, we also welcome private-paying children, offering them the same level of care and education as any other kindergarten. Our foundation is staffed with qualified teachers who are dedicated to the development and well-being of every child.

We invite you to learn more about us, what we do, and why we do it. Understanding our role in the community is key to appreciating the difference we make in the lives of the children and families we serve. This is our story.
